# Demystifying Generative AI And Machine Learning Models
### Women In Tech Boston; Oct 2-3, 2023

## Hands-On workshop to build a custom application using a pre-trained and fine-tuned Large Language Model (Llama2)
This repository conrains instructions and code for building custom applications using LLM, dataset builder utility code for generaiting a custom mini training dataset for cost effective model tuning.

Overall, the goal of this workshop is to familiarize you with
* Generative AI models ecosystem
* Core concepts of the LLMs
* Prompt Engineering

Repository contains
* Installation instructions for some Open Source technologies
* Setup instructions to use Open Sourced Meta Llama2 models
* Code to build simple chatbot application using Llama2 and Streamlit
* Custom mini dataset creator for fine tuning Llama2
* Sample dataset
* Replicate model training scripts
